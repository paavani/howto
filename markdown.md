## Markdown
Markdown is a way to style text on the web.You control the display of the document.formatting words as bold or italic,adding images,and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. 
Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like # or *
	mostly we can use in GITHUB  and BITBUCKET

	Save: Files with the .md or .markdown extension

## Headers

```

Alternatively, for H1 and H2, an underline-ish style:

------
```

Example:

```
	True is:

	> We're living the future so

## Lists

1. Unordered:

```
	*item1
	*Item2
		*Item 2a
		*Item 2b
```
2.Ordered
```
	1. Item 1
	1. Item 2
	1. Item 3
	   1. Item 3a
		2. Item 3b
```

    1. Item 1
    1. Item 2
    1. Item 3
			1. Item 3a
			2. Item 3a

```
Sometimes you want bullet points:

* Start a line with a star
* Profit!

Alternatively,

- Dashes work just as well
- And if you have sub points, put two spaces before the dash or star:
  - Like this
  - And this

## Task Lists

```
- [x] @mentions, #refs, [links](), **formatting**, and <del>tags</del> supported
- [x] list syntax required (any unordered or ordered list supported)
- [x] this is a complete item
- [ ] this is an incomplete item
```
  > It work's in github
  But I have to admit, tasks lists are my favorite:

  - [x] This is a complete item
  - [ ] This is an incomplete item
